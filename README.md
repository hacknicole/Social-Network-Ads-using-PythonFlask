# Social Network Ads
<p align="justify">Social media is forming an increasingly central part of
how companies communicate their marketing strategies to their
customers and it provides an empirical analysis of the impact
social media communication has on brand equity and purchase
intention. The aim is to investigate given social advertisement
datasets by supervised machine learning methods like Random Forest 
Classification and to predict whether a user purchased a particular product or
not on social media network advertisements.</p>

# Dataset Provided
<p align="justify"> The <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakeshrau/social-network-ads"> Social Network Ads</a> dataset is provided through Kaggle authorized by Rakesh Raushan.</p>

# Render 
<p align="justify"> Render is a unified cloud to build and run all your apps and websites with free SSL, global CDN, private networks, and automatic deploys from Git. 
Based on this, I have created a hosted website in Social Network Ads which allows the user to enter details such as UserId, Age, and Estimated Salary and predict the output 
whether the user has purchased the product or not using FlaskApp and Machine Learning.</p>
